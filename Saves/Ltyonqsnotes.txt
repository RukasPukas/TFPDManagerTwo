Made some updates to TFPD Manager 2.

I bought a computer mic for the front office, this is for anyone to use.

I brought in my old battery powered vaccum that still works great. It is in the day room along with a battery and the charger.

2042 needs to be scheduled for repairs. Jeremy if you would get with chief Davis over this.
